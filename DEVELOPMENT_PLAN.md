## 4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 4.1 Core Systems Implementation

**Resource Management:**
```gdscript
class_name ResourceManager extends Node

signal spice_changed(amount)
var spice: int = 1000

func add_spice(amount: int):
    spice += amount
    spice_changed.emit(spice)

func spend_spice(amount: int) -> bool:
    if spice >= amount:
        spice -= amount
        spice_changed.emit(spice)
        return true
    return false
```

**Unit Movement System:**
```gdscript
class_name Unit extends CharacterBody2D

@export var move_speed: float = 100.0
@export var max_health: float = 100.0
var current_health: float

var target_position: Vector2
var path: Array[Vector2]
var navigation_agent: NavigationAgent2D

func move_to(target: Vector2):
    target_position = target
    navigation_agent.target_position = target
```

**Building Placement:**
```gdscript
class_name BuildingManager extends Node2D

func can_place_building(building_type: String, position: Vector2) -> bool:
    # Check for obstacles, power requirements, adjacency rules
    return is_position_valid(position) and has_power() and is_connected_to_base(position)
```

### 4.2 Performance Optimization Strategies
